# Dynamic DOM Table challenge

This challenge is designed to help beginners and intermediate programmers and web developers to master DOM manipulation with Javascript.
This challenge does not intent to produce a useful DOM table for real world use, but is designed in a way that, if the developer is able to finish it, will provide the developer with an advanced knowledge and skill on DOM manipulation with Javascript.
It's a complex challenge, but nonetheless interesting and useful to close gaps around DOM manipulation.

See the "Table specs.xlsx" file for more details on how the table should look.

To begin, fork this project, clone it, create a new folder inside "DOM Table challenge" folder and start solving the challenge there. Push a pull request for me to be able to review your solution.

## Requirements:

1) Table should be dynamic: starts empty, new rows and columns should be created when pressing the New Row and New Column buttons. The first row is considered the header of the table.
   
2) Table should be sortable: when clicking on a header, the table should sort by the values on that column. For example, if you click on Id column, then the whole table should sort by the values in that Id column.


3) Cells should be editable: when double clicking on a cell, it should get into the 'Editing' mode and allow the value to be changed. When hitting enter, it should get out of the 'Editing' mode and keep the new value.


4) Table should be paginated: when the table has more than 10 records, the exceeding records should not be seen on the first page, but when you click on the next page. Should be able to go the the previous page as well. Should not try to go to a page that does exist (pagination buttons should activate and deactivate based on that logic). Pagination bar should have Previous, 1, 2, 3, ..., Next buttons.


5) Cells should be typed: when clicking on New Column, a modal form should pop up to specify the type of that column. The form should have the following fields:
Header: the text that will show up in the header (like Id, Name, Age, etc).
Type (can be number, string, email, url). This is to format the table accordingly. If it's an url, then when Ctrl + left clicking on the cell, it should take you to that link. If it's an email, it should open the mailto option to send an email. If it's a number, it should right align the context of the cell.
If it's a text, it should left align it.
If a cell is of type number, it should not allow any text, url, etc. Only number should be allowed. If a cell is of type email, a valid email format should be provided or it won't accept the edit. If it's of type link, a valid url needs to be provided or it will not accept the edit, showing a message saying it.


1) Columns and Rows should be reorderable: when you click on a column header and start to drag it, that column should be able to move from one position to another. For example, if we have columns Id, Name, Age, and I want to move Age to the second position, I should be able to hold it and drag it to the second position so the columns should now be: Id, Age, Name.
When pressing Ctrl + left click on a row, this row should now be draggable and can be moved to another position.


7) Table content should be saved in localStorage: every time a change is made on the table (a new row, a new column, cell edit, etc.) it should be saved in localStorage. The table should a JavaScript object representation, the one below. 
This way is easier to persist (like in a db or localStorage).
When the page is reloaded, the first thing that it should do is to try to get the table JavaScript object representation from the localStorage and recreate the table from there. If the table is not in the local storage, then simply create an empty \<table>\</table> and get ready for New Row and New Column events.

8) Rows should be selectable. The first column should be a checkbox to select that specific record or multiple records or all the records. This checkbox column should be created by default for all rows.
Delete button should be disabled by default. Only when at least one row is selected, the Delete button should be active. When clicking on this Delete button, the selected row(s) should be deleted. When clicking on the delete button, there should be a confirmation message.

9) Table should be searchable. There should be an input on top of the table to type text and filter the table based on that text.

10) Table should have a action button (gear icon) on the right most header cell. When clicking on this icon, a context menu should pop up and show options to set all the rows editable, copy the whole table to JSON or CSV, delete all rows.

11) Table and buttons should look nice. Use only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No library is allowed.


12) Push the code to GitHub on a public repository and share the link to check the code.
