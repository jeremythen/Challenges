# Challenges

This repo holds programming challenges descriptions for programmers and web developers to fork and practice.

These challenges are designed to help beginners and intermediate programmers and web developers to master base concepts of Computer Science, programming and web development skills.

Originally created by me, Jeremy Then, for the developers I mentor and for our Software Rookies community, where I teach and guide beginners and intermediate developers, along with other experienced developers. I now make these challenges public for anybody to go ahead and practice if they find them interesting.

More challenges will be added as I finish designing them.

As of now, I have 2 challenges available:

1) Data Structures
    A challenge designed to help beginners and intermediate programmers to implement and understand Data Structures.
2) DOM Table challenge
    A challenge designed to help beginners and intermediate programmers and web developers to master DOM manipulation with Javascript.
