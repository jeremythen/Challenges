## Implementation details

### Array List

Implement this data structure with an array (as the name suggests).

Document all the methods and specify the time and space complexity and the reason why this is, on the documentation comment.

Add an `void add` method to add elements to the list. Make sure there is enough free space in the implementation array before adding new elements. The list should grow dynamically if needed. For this, recreation of the implementing array may be needed. When the implementing array is already reaching it's capacity, create a new implementing array with double the capacity and copy the elements to this new array.

Implement a `T get(int index)` method to return the element at the index specified in the parameter. If an invalid index is provided (index < 0 or index >= array.length), throw an error specifying that.

Implement a `boolean remove(int index)` method to remove the element at the index specified in the parameter. If an invalid index is provided (index < 0 or index >= array.length), throw an error specifying that.
When removing an item from the implementing array, shifting to the left of the remaining items on the right may be needed.
If we have an array like this: `[1,2,3,4,5]`, and we are told to remove the element at index 2 (which is the element 3 in the array), then the array should look like this after the removal: `[1,2,4,5, null]`. Basically shifting left the elements to the right of the array. At this point, the last position of this array should be ignore because it doesn't represent a valid element and the size of the list should be 4, not  5.

Implement a `boolean remove(T element)` method to remove the element with the specified value.
Return true if the element was found and removed. False otherwise.
And follow the same rules as above.

Implement a `boolean contains(T element)` method to see if the list has that element. 

Implement a `int size()` method to return the number of elements in the implementation array.

Implement a `boolean isEmpty` method to return if the list is empty or not.

Implement a `void reverse()` method to reverse the array list.

Implement a `String toString()` method to return a representation of the list values in a string.

### Linked List

Implement all the methods defined in the Array List, following the same rules when applicable.
For example, in the `remove` method, implementing it with a linked list we won't need to shift any elements to the left, simply make the previous element point to the next element and make the method to be removed point to null.
In your implementation, use a Node<E> object that will contain the node value and point to the next element.

#### Problems to resolve on a linked list:

1) Reverse the linked list
   1) Iteratively, using a second data structure to hold the data temporarily.
   2) Recursively, without using any intermediate data structure, just recursion.
2) Check if a linked list has cycles.
   1) Using intermediate data structures
   2) Using no other data structure
3) Finding the the element in the middle of the linked list
   1) Without having the size beforehand
   2) Having the size beforehand
   3) Using fast and slow fast pointers

...

### Doubly Link List

#### Problems to resolve on a queue:

1) Reverse the queue
   1) Reverse it using a backing data structure
   2) Reverse it using recursion

### Stack

Document the methods and specify the time and space complexity and the reason why this is, on the documentation comment.

A Stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure.

1) Implement an ArrayStack (stack implemented with an array as the backing data structure).
   
2) Implement a LinkedStack (stack implemented with a Doubly Link List as the backing data structure)
#### Methods to implement

   2) Reverse it using recursion

1) Implement an ArrayDeque (deque implemented with an array as the backing data structure).
   
2) Implement a LinkedDeque (deque implemented with a Doubly Link List as the backing data structure)

### HashMap

Document the methods and specify the time and space complexity and the reason why this is, on the documentation comment.

This data structure is implemented with an array as the backing data structure.
The keys (which may be of any type) need to be converted into a valid positive integer to use as an index for the array. This has to be done with a `int hashingFunction(K key)`, a function that takes an input and converts it into a valid array index.

This map will need to grow dynamically to any required number of elements.

This data structure needs to be able to manage collisions with a **Separate Chaining** approach.

#### Methods to implement

Implement a `V put(K key, V value)` method to add a record to the hash map.

Implement a `V get(K key)` method to get the value of the element under that key.

Implement a `V remove(K key)` method to remove the element under that key, returning it too.

Implement a `boolean containsKey(K key)` method to check if the map contains that key.

   {key1: value1, key2: value2}
```

### HashSet

A set is a data structure that doesn't allow any duplicates.

This data structure is implemented with an array as the backing data structure.
The elements need to be converted into a valid positive integer to use as an index for the array. This has to be done with a `int hashingFunction(K key)`, a function that takes an input and converts it into a valid array index.

This set will need to grow dynamically to any required number of elements.

This data structure needs to be able to manage collisions with a **Separate Chaining** approach.

Implement a `boolean isEmpty` method to check if the set is empty.

Implement a `String toString()` method to return a representation of the set values in a string:
```
   [1,2,3]
```

### Linked Hash Map

Document the methods and specify the time and space complexity and the reason why this is, on the documentation comment.

A Linked Hash Map is a hash map implemented with an array of linked nodes, in a way that each know inserted points to another node, just a regular singly linked list. This is useful to keep the order in each the elements were inserted in the hash map, while keeping the same time complexity and efficiency on the put/get/remove operations of the hash map.

#### Methods to implement

Implement all the methods defined in the Hash Map.

When implementing `V[] getValues()` and `V[] getEntries()` methods, the values and entries should be returned in the order in which they were added to the map.

### Binary Search Tree

A Binary Search Tree is a data structure composed of nodes that can have up to 2 childing nodes. The first and main node is called the root node. Each node's child greater than the parent node needs to be to the right of the parent, and each node's child node less than the parent node needs to be to the left of the node.

In this way, the search is really efficient, because when searching for a specific key or value, you will either go to the left or to the right and after each step, you will skip have of the remaining tree.

To implement this data structure, use a sort of linked node, where the node is an objet that contains 3 properties:

```
Node
 Node leftChild
 Node rightChild
 V value
```

where the leftChild will point to the node (or subtree) to the left (nodes whose values are less than their parent value).
Where the rightChild will point to the node (or subtree) to the right (nodes whose values are greater than their parent value).
And value, which will contain the value to keep and compare.

#### Methods to implement

Implement a `void add(T element)` method to add an element to the tree.  If the tree is empty, this will be the root node.

Implement a `boolean remove(T element)` method to remove the specify value from the tree. Note that you will need to find a successor or predecessor to replace that node to keep the structure of the tree internally.

Implement a `T getSuccessor(T element)` method to return the successor of this element. The successor is the element that would naturally succeed the specified element. If we have the elements 4,8,12,17,22,16, the successor of 12 if 17, because if we have all the numbers in order, 17 is the number that exactly goes after 12, based on their natural order.
The successor of a node in a binary search tree is the left-most child of the first right child of the node.

Implement a `T getPredecessor(T element)` method to return the predecessor of this element. The predecessor is the element that would naturally precede the specified element. If we have the elements 4,8,12,17,22,16, the predecessor of 12 if 8, because if we have all the numbers in order, 8 is the number that exactly goes before 12, based on their natural order.
The predecessor of a node in a binary search tree is the right-most child of the first left child of the node.

Implement a `String toStringInOder()` method to return a string representation of the binary search tree being traversed in an In Order way.

Implement a `String toStringPostOrder()` method to return a string representation of the binary search tree being traversed in an Post Order way.

Implement a `String toStringPreOrder()` method to return a string representation of the binary search tree being traversed in an Pre Order way.

Implement a `T[] toArrayInOrder()` method to return an array with all the elements from the tree, traversed in a In Order way.

Implement a `T[] toArrayBreadthFirst()` method to return an array with all the elements from the tree, traversed in a Breadth-first way.

### Binary Heap (Min and Max heap)

Document the methods and specify the time and space complexity and the reason why this is, on the documentation comment.

The Binary Heap data structure, is a binary tree where the root node keeps the smallest value in the tree (Min Heap), or the greatest value in the tree (Max Heap), in a way that, it's really efficient to see (peek) the smallest/greatest value in the tree (constant time).

1) Implement a Min Heap
2) Implement a Max Heap

This data structure is usually implemented with an array as the backing data structure.

In a Max Heap, the value in each node is greater than or equal to the values of it's children.

In a Min Heap, the value in each node is smaller than or equal to the value of it's children.

If we were to remove the root node, then we would need to find the next greatest (Max Heap) or smallest (Min Heap) to make it now the greatest/smallest in that heap.


#### Methods to implement

Implement a `void add(T element)` method to add an element to the heap.

Implement a `T peek()` method to retrieve, but not remove, the value of the root node (the min element if it's a Min Heap, the max value if it's a Max Heap).

Implement a `T remove()` method to remove and retrieve the value of the root node. This method should find the next min/max value to replace this element before turning.

Implement a `T[] removeAll()` method to remove and retrieve all the elements in the tree. If it's a Min Heap, these values should be sorted in a ascending order. If it's a Max Heap, these values should now be sorted in a descending order.

Implement a `int size()` method to see the size of the tree.

Implement a `boolean isEmpty()` method to see if the tree is empty.

### Priority Queue

Document the methods and specify the time and space complexity and the reason why this is, on the documentation comment.

A Priority Queue is a queue that automatically orders the element just added, to the position in the queue where it belongs based on it's priority.

The priority can be anything. For simplicity, let's say that the priority is the same value that we are trying to push to the queue. If we are pushing integer numbers, then the value of these integers will be their priority.

This data structure can be implemented using a Min or Max heap as the backing data structure, depending on how you want to treat the priorities. If a smaller value means more priority, then use a Min Heap to implement the priority queue.
If a greater value means more priority, then use a Max Heap to implement the priority queue.

The contract for this data structure, as it's name suggests, is exactly the same as a regular queue. The only difference is how it works internally. If an element is pushed at the tail of the queue, that element will potentially bubble up until it reaches the head of the line, if it's the smallest value (in a Min Heap), or if it's the greatest value (in a Max Heap).

#### Methods to implement

Implement all the methods defined in the Queue.

### Graph

Implement a Graph with an Adjacency List, weighted and unweighted, directed and undirected.
Implement a simple Graph with an Adjacency Matrix.

Implement a Depth First Search.
Implement a Breadth First Search.

Advanced:

Implement a Minimum Spanning Tree
Implement a Shortest Path

## After Implementation

After implementing the data structures and analyzing the time and space complexity for all of the common operations on them, compare the similar data structures and based on how the work, time and space complexity, think about the following:

1) Which is best for which scenario
   1) Which is more efficient in terms of time and/or space complexity for certain scenarios.

For example, we can compare an ArrayList with a LinkedList and think in which cases each of them could be a better option.
When implementing an ArrayList, since we use an array as our backing data structure and the arrays once created they cannot grow dynamically, we need to create a new array with twice the space as the previous one and copy all the values of the previous array, whenever the previous array reaches it's maximum capacity while adding a new element.
The LinkedList doesn't have to deal with that overhead.

This is a good example. There are more things to think about for each data structure. Try to figure it out comparing the same operations on similar data structures and write some comments about, probably in a new .md file and push it with your solutions.

To give you a heads up, try thinking about these after implementing them:

Differences and similarities in terms of time and space complexity of:

1) ArrayList vs. LinkedList
   1) On their `add` methods
   2) On their `get(int index)` methods
   3) On their `remove(int index)` methods
2) ArrayQueue vs. LinkedQueue
   1) On their `add` methods
   2) On their `remove` methods
   3) On their `poll` methods
   4) 3) On their `peek` methods
3) ArrayStack vs. LinkedStack
   1) On their `push` methods
   2) On their `pop` methods
   3) On their `peek` methods

This will help you make a better decisions when selecting a data structure depending on the scenario.
